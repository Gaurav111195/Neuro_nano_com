The C++ code is the mathematical modeling of nano-micro communication systems in a single neuron cell. 
It addresses the calcium hypothesis of neurodegeneration by considering relevant single cell biological phenomenon. The effect of amyloid beta oligomers to regulate calcium ions via calcium channel membrane receptors or pore formation are considered along with the downstream impact on BDNF fast axonal transport. 
Included features are microtubule numbers and spacing in the axon for BDNF transport that  employs a Lagrangian relaxation subgradient optimization algorithm. 
The model extends concepts of the IEEE Standards Association P1906.1 Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework.
